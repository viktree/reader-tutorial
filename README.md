# ReaderT Tutorial [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/diogob/reader-tutorial.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/diogob/reader-tutorial)

## Quickstart

Ensure that you have installed stack:

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

In the project root run:

```shell
stack --install-ghc test
```

The above command will install the appropriate compiler and build the project libraries and test suite.

## Using a ReaderT

Using functions from the module `CoinberryApi` and the `App` type provided by `Transformer` build a program that will fetch the prices for a given currency and display it.

An example of usage would be:

```shell
CURRENCY=BTC stack exec price
You can buy BTC for 6761.49
```

The currency should be passed in an environment variable and can be one of **BTC**, **ETH**, **LTC** or **XRP**.

The program should use all effectful computations from the `Context`, never importing directly functions that run in `IO`.

## Creating tests

In the test suite we want to mock all effectful computations from `IO`.
Namely the HTTP GET requests and the calls to print to the console.
In order to achieve this model the necessary functions as part of the `Context` in the `App` type and supply the mock functions when running the tests.
